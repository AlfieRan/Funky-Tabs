# FunkyTabs
FunkyTabs is a Chrome extension that replaces your New Tab page with a FunkyTab, as of the current version this includes a photo of Mark Zuckerberg, the time, the date and a notepad for you to use.

The original github repo is from Lucid and it uses the notepad and date functuality from this. However any other part of the extension has been added by Alfie Ranstead and is Unique to FunkyTabs.

If you couldn't tell this is also the first chrome extension I have ever made.


# Lucid
Lucid is a Chrome Extension that replaces your New Tab page with a notepad. It
also tells you what day it is. It uses your location to determine whether it
should have a dark background or a light one, based on daylight hours.
